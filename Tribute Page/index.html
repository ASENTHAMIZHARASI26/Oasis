          <p>Kalpana Chawla (1962-2003) was an Indian-American <br>
            astronaut and the first woman of Indian origin to <br>
            go to space, serving as a mission specialist on Space<br>
            Shuttle Columbia for two missions (STS-87 in 1997 and <br>
            STS-107 in 2003). Born in Karnal, India, she earned <br>
            degrees in aerospace engineering from India and the U.S<br>
            later working at NASA before her selection as an astronaut<br>
